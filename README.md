# Lucas Kemper

Quantitative finance researcher specializing in market regime detection and systematic trading systems.

## Research

**Hybrid Regime Detection in Semiconductor Equities: A Bayesian HMM-LSTM Framework**  
*SSRN Working Paper* | [Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5366835) | [Code](https://github.com/lucaskemper/hybridquantregimes)

- Combined HMM and LSTM outputs using entropy-weighted Bayesian model averaging
- Achieved >50% volatility reduction and 15-17pt drawdown improvement vs static benchmarks
- Production-ready framework with comprehensive backtesting and Monte Carlo simulation
