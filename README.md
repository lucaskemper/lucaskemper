# Lucas Kemper  
### Machine Learning • DeFi Systems • MEV Research  

I study how adversarial dynamics and execution constraints shape behavior in decentralized markets.  
My work focuses on **machine learning**, **MEV**, **market microstructure**, and **simulation-based analysis**.

## Research

### **Hybrid Regime Detection in Semiconductor Equities**  
*SSRN Working Paper*  
[Paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i0ghAdcAAAAJ&hl=en) • [Code](https://github.com/lucaskemper/hybridquantregimes)

A Bayesian HMM–LSTM framework for multi-horizon regime detection with full backtesting, Monte Carlo stress tests, and diagnostics.

## Current Projects

### **MEV-Informed Portfolio Behavior**  
Repo: https://github.com/lucaskemper/mev-portfolio-analysis  

Quantifies how sandwich attacks and gas regimes distort execution costs in AMMs.  
Empirical basis for my MSc thesis on **MEV-aware reinforcement learning**.

### **Narrative Alpha Detector (Prediction Markets)**  
Repo: https://github.com/lucaskemper/narrative-alpha  

Ensemble probability modeling (GPT, Claude, Grok, Perplexity Sonar) for detecting mispricings on Polymarket.  
Includes confidence weighting, regime tagging, and full audit trail logging.

### **Crypto Trading & Arbitrage System (WIP)**  
Repo: https://github.com/lucaskemper/cryptotrading  

Infrastructure for multi-exchange execution and statistical arbitrage using async pipelines, microstructure-aware routing, and ML-driven signal fusion.

## Technical Stack

**ML/AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, hmmlearn  
**Systems:** Docker, async pipelines, WebSockets  
**Data:** NumPy, pandas, statsmodels  
**Languages:** Python, R, MATLAB, SQL
