# Lucas Kemper  
**Machine Learning for Markets • DeFi Systems • MEV Research**  

I study how adversarial dynamics and execution constraints shape behavior in decentralized markets.  
My work focuses on **machine learning**, **MEV**, **market microstructure**, and **simulation-based analysis** applied to both DeFi and traditional financial systems.

## 🧩 Current Projects

### **MEV-Informed Portfolio Behavior**  
Repo: https://github.com/lucaskemper/mev-portfolio-analysis  

Quantifies how sandwich attacks and gas regimes distort execution costs in AMMs.  
Forms the empirical basis for my MSc thesis on **MEV-aware reinforcement learning** for portfolio execution.

### **Narrative Alpha Detector (Prediction Markets)**  
Repo: https://github.com/lucaskemper/narrative-alpha-public  

Ensemble probability modeling (GPT, Claude, Grok, etc.) for detecting mispricings in prediction markets.  
Emphasizes explainability, confidence weighting, and traceable model outputs.

### **Crypto Trading & Arbitrage System (WIP)**  
Repo: https://github.com/lucaskemper/cryptotrading  

Infrastructure for multi-exchange execution and statistical arbitrage.  
Focuses on realistic microstructure constraints, async execution, and ML-driven signal fusion.
