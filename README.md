# Lucas Kemper

Quantitative finance researcher specializing in market regime detection and systematic trading systems.

## Research

**Hybrid Regime Detection in Semiconductor Equities: A Bayesian HMM-LSTM Framework**  
*SSRN Working Paper* | [Paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i0ghAdcAAAAJ&hl=en) | [Code](https://github.com/lucaskemper/hybridquantregimes)

- Combined HMM and LSTM outputs using entropy-weighted Bayesian model averaging
- Achieved >50% volatility reduction and 15-17pt drawdown improvement vs static benchmarks
- Production-ready framework with comprehensive backtesting and Monte Carlo simulation

## Projects

**[MEV Portfolio Analysis & Msc Thesis Proposal](https://github.com/lucaskemper/mev-portfolio-analysis)** - Impact of sandwich attacks on execution costs
- Analyzed 10K blocks across gas regimes
- Sandwich attacks increase costs 2.9x (77 vs 27 bps)
- High-gas regimes show 2x portfolio rebalancing costs
