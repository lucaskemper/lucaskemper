## 👋 About Me
At the intersection of finance and artificial intelligence, I explore how cutting-edge AI can revolutionize financial markets. As a Swiss MSc Finance student, I combine rigorous quantitative analysis with innovative AI approaches to develop next-generation financial solutions.

My work is driven by the belief that AI will fundamentally transform how we understand and interact with financial systems. Through methodical problem-solving and data synthesis, I build bridges between traditional finance and emerging AI technologies.
